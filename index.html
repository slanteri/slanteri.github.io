      I  am  a  senior  research  scientist at  the  Inria  center  of

      head   of    the   <a   href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/atlantis/"

      target=_blank>DIOGENeS</a>  software development  project, which
      is  dedicated  to   computational  nanophotonics.   My  research
      interests are concerned with  different aspects of the numerical
      modeling   of  physical   problems   related  to   computational
      electromagnetics  and  computational  nanophotonics.   I  am  in
      particular  working on  the design  of high  order discontinuous

      algorithms for  solving differential  models of  time-domain and
      frequency-domain electromagnetic  wave propagation  with complex
      media with a focus of nanoscale light-matter interactions.  I am

	  project-team (Inria center of Université Côte d’Azur) we develop inverse design methodologies to unveil non-intuitive

        <p align="justify">
	The  development of  agile,  ultra-flat  and low-cost  Ka-band
	antennas is a major challenge to enable Internet accessibility
	in mobility,  in particular  on board of  public land  and air
	transport   (trains,   buses,   airliners),  and   to   secure
	communication servers (for combat aircraft, military vehicles,
	etc.).  A  possible  antenna   architecture  to  address  this
	challenge is composed  of a radiating source  and a deflection
	system consisting  of two deflectors. The  compactness and the
	moderate  cost of  the  de-pointing system  could be  obtained
	thanks to the subwavelength  structuring technique, and to the
	shaping by additive manufacturing.  Indeed, the sub-wavelength
	patterning  technique has  recently shown  the possibility  to
	realize  antenna components  much thinner  than a  homogeneous
	bulk material, with equivalent  or even better radio frequency
	performance. The general objective  of our contribution to the
	AEROCOM  project, which  is  supported by  the French  Defence
	Innovation Agency (from January 2023 to September 2025), is to
	develop  an advanced  numerical  methodology  for the  virtual
	design  of  subwavelength   structured  deflectors  and  their
	cascading  to achieve  an  ultra-flat  Ka-band antenna  system
	consisting of two such metadeflectors.

        <p align="justify">
	Beam steering is a key enabling photonic technology that would
	improve the performance of light detection and ranging modules
	(LiDAR). A typical LiDAR component  consists of a light source
	for illumination, a light modulating  device to scan the scene
	and finally  a fast  detection system  to recover  the optical
	information  received from  the  scene.  The  LiDAR sector  is
	currently ongoing  important research and  development efforts
	to  enable real-time  sensing of  the distance  of fast-moving
	objects,  with applications  in robotics,  autonomous vehicles
	and future  augmented reality devices.  Dynamic  beam steering
	with  competitive performances  requires the  deflection of  a
	light beam along  any arbitrary direction to  spatially scan a
	large  angular field-of-view  (FoV) with  high speed  and high
	efficiency.   In the  SWEET project,  which is  funded by  the
	French National Research Agency (from October 2022 to December
	2026),  several drawbacks  of current  LiDAR technologies  are
	addressed  by  proposing  innovative ultrafast  beam  steering
	systems,    their    combinations   and    integration    into
	demonstrator. The overarching goal  is to realize an ultrafast
	2D beam  steering system using innovative  transparent tunable
	metasurfaces using  liquid crystal and  III-nitride materials.
	In  this context,  we work  on the  design active  metasurface
	components for dynamic beam steering.

        <summary>SWAG-P (Sensing With A Gap-Plasmon)</summary>
        <p align="justify">
	Among all  the techniques  used to design  biosensors, optical
	techniques  are booming,  thanks  to  numerous innovations  in
	nanophotonics and plasmonics. Using lithography to fabricate a
	sensor usually makes  it too expensive.  To  be deliverable, a
	device has to be stable for  months. It is important to use as
	little  materials  as possible,  because  sensors  have to  be
	disposed of  after use. Miniaturization is  attractive in this
	perspective,  especially since  it  is  associated with  lower
	detection  limits.  Plasmonic  resonators have  an  edge  here
	because  of  their   large  interaction  cross-section:  their
	response is  thus easier  to measure. The  goal of  the SWAG-P
	project,  which  is funded  by  the  French National  Research
	Agency (from October 2023 to December 2027), is to explore the
	potential of a  new class of plasmonic  resonators with unique
	properties,  called  Gap-Plasmon  Resonators (GPRs),  for  the
	detection   of  biological   molecules   of  interest.   These
	resonators are  optical patch antennas that  can be fabricated
	simply  by  depositing  metal  nanocubes  of  a  few  tens  of
	nanometers  on a  dielectric film,  deposited on  a very  thin
	layer  of  functionalizable  gold.    In  SWAG-P,  we  develop
	reduced-order modeling  techniques for the  numerical modeling
	of GPR-based biosensors.
